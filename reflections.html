  <h2 id="on-certainty">On Certainty and Mathematical Reality</h2>
  <p>
    In a world where truth is often shaped by perception, the internal consistency of mathematics offers something deeply compelling. Unlike physical observation, mathematical statements, once proven, are unassailably true within their framework...

  <h2 id="geometry-of-abstraction">The Geometry of Abstraction</h2>
  <p>
    Algebraic geometry, at first glance, seems divorced from geometry as we know it—angles, distances, curvature. But its power lies in what it abstracts: the idea that shape can be encoded by equations, that symmetry and structure reveal truths across fields...
