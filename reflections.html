    <summary>On the Importance of Precision of Language</summary>
    <div>
      <p><em>In this essay, I respond to a question posed by a philosophy classmate at Madison: "If mathematics is so remarkably successful at describing the universe, does that not support the existence of a creator of the universe?"</em></p>

      <p>Imagine I am holding a single grain of sand in my palm. I ask you, "Is this a heap of sand?"</p>
      <p>You, being the reasonable human you are, look at me quizzically and ask why I'd even pose such a trivial question. I reply, "Never mind that — just humor me and help me out with this experiment."</p>
      <p>After adding another grain, I ask again, "Now do I have a heap?"</p>
      <p>"No, of course not."</p>
      <p>Eventually, after painstakingly adding tens, maybe hundreds, or even thousands of individual grains, you reach a point where you’re no longer sure how to respond. On one hand, I’m now holding something that definitely resembles a heap. On the other, you think: <em>But I just said it wasn’t a heap last time, and all he did was add one more grain. How could a single grain of sand turn a non-heap into a heap?</em></p>
      <p>Then you wonder: <em>So where should I have said yes? The last time? Ten times before? A hundred?</em></p>
      <p>You're not at fault for this uncertainty — anyone as logical as you would face the same dilemma. The issue lies in the vagueness of the word "heap." It lacks precise criteria, so logical reasoning struggles to apply. Let's formalize this by pairing your reasoning with a few plausible premises:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>1 grain of sand is not a heap.</li>
        <li>For any positive integer \( n \), if \( n \) grains of sand is not a heap, then \( n + 1 \) grains of sand is not a heap.</li>
        <li>1 billion grains of sand is a heap.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You might object: "If those billion grains were spread across the Earth, it wouldn't be a heap!" Fair. So let’s assume they are placed in a reasonable pile — no tricks or loopholes. We now show that these three premises are inconsistent using a standard mathematical proof technique: induction.</p>

      <p>We claim that if Premises 1 and 2 are true, then for any positive integer \( n \), \( n \) grains of sand is not a heap.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base case:</strong> \( n = 1 \). Premise 1 gives us that 1 grain is not a heap.</li>
        <li><strong>Inductive step:</strong> Suppose \( n \) grains is not a heap. Then Premise 2 implies that \( n + 1 \) grains is also not a heap.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By mathematical induction, all positive integers fail to form a heap — including 1 billion grains — contradicting Premise 3.</p>

      <p>If you’re unfamiliar with induction, here’s an intuition: imagine lining up an infinite number of dominos. The base case knocks over the first one. The inductive step ensures that if any domino falls, the next will too. Together, they prove every domino falls — just like we proved every number of grains isn’t a heap.</p>

      <p>So what went wrong? Our reasoning was valid. Our premises seemed reasonable. Yet we reached a contradiction — a paradox. My resolution: we should not expect vague, everyday language to behave well under formal logic. Logic requires precise objects and definitions, not fuzzy boundaries or subjective interpretation.</p>

      <p>Suppose we tried to formalize “heap” with precision: how many grains, how closely packed, their dimensions, their shape, etc. The resulting definition would be long and hard to apply in real-time conversation. But that vagueness is what makes the word "heap" so usable in daily life. It’s fast, flexible, and generally good enough. For casual use, imprecision is an asset.</p>

      <p>But in disciplines where precision, truth, and consistency matter — like science or mathematics — vagueness is fatal. There, the tradeoff of accessibility for exactness is well worth it.</p>

      <p>Try this: define “heap” with a list of precise conditions. Then examine each condition — is it itself vague? If so, define that term too. Eventually you’ll reach a stopping point: a primitive concept that can’t be defined further without circularity. In mathematics, that’s exactly how it works.</p>

      <p>Mathematics builds everything — numbers, functions, spaces — from primitive objects like sets. A set is inherently precise. It has no gray area. So mathematics succeeds not because it is magically aligned with the universe, but because it is the only system we’ve created that is <em>precise enough</em> for logic to fully apply. Every concept has a fixed definition; every step of reasoning is constrained by rules.</p>

      <p>So in response to the question: no, I don’t think mathematics needs a divine explanation. I believe its success is due to its unparalleled clarity — a clarity that comes from working only with well-defined, precisely constructed objects. If any other field could match that, perhaps it too would enjoy the same predictive power and elegance.</p>

      <p><strong>Mathematics works not because the universe was written in its language, but because mathematics is the only language we’ve refined enough to speak clearly.</strong></p>

    <summary>The Danger in Abstraction and Modeling Reality Axiomatically </summary>
    <div>
      <p><em>Mathematics is undoubtedly one of the most sucessful tools known to mankind; however, are there any drawbacks to the pure deductive reasoning found exclusively in mathematics?</em></p>

      <p>The distinctive feature of mathematics compared to the other sciences is that remarkably, mathematics is not grounded in reality, despite its wide application to our understanding of the world through other disciples.
        For instance, in physics one observes an object falling and wants to understand this phenomenon better. In chemistry, one observes heat being released when two solutions are mixed, and wants to understand why some processes seem to "create" heat, while others don't. Or in biology, how is it that cells know which proteins to create, and at the right time?
        To answer these questions, one creates theories, and tests them with experiments, ensuring the theories can't deviate from reality too much.</p>
      <p>But mathematics is different--mathematical objects are defined by the rules the should satisfy, known as the axiomatic method. This approach has proven to have great advantages--for instance, because mathematical objects exist independent of physical reality, mathematics is never reliant on advanced technologies. To give an example of why this is nice, consider the case of string theory in physics.
        String theory is an attempt to unify various theories in physics that seem incompatible by hypothesizing the existence of tiny (even compared to the quantum scale) strings that vibrate with various frequencies. However, as beautifully as the theory is, it doesn't seem possible to experimentally verify any of its claims, which some physicists critize. However, in math, technology can help speed up the process of finding new results by looking
